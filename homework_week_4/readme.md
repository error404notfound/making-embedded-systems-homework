# Sensory stone subsystem

## description. 

The aim of this project would be to implement some of the functionality of the [Sensory stones]() project. 

  * implement shake to wake
  * implement cli 
     *  pass test data to the cli
     *  mimic commands that would be replicated over ble 
        * output accelerometor data
        * set game state  
     *  test perpiherlas
     
  * Gesture recognition utilising the accelerometor to set mode ( using edge impulse to generate model ) ( detect 3 modes ) 
  * Implement the breathing pattern trainer using LCD  for visual feedback. 
  * Sleep timer
  * Save user settings to non volitaile memeory
