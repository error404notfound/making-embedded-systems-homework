# Homework week 4

There are 4 ideas that I have for my final project I decided to flesh them out a little before deciding which one to pursue. 
* [Stone subsystem](https://github.com/error404notfound/making-embedded-systems-homework/tree/main/homework_week_4/stone)
* [Trampoline game](https://github.com/error404notfound/making-embedded-systems-homework/tree/main/homework_week_4/trampoline%20controller)
* [Promodo timer](https://github.com/error404notfound/making-embedded-systems-homework/tree/main/homework_week_4/promodo%20timer)
* [Activity tracker](https://github.com/error404notfound/making-embedded-systems-homework/tree/main/homework_week_4/Activity%20tracker)
