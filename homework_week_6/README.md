## Licenses
### ST - HAL

HALs are distributed under the 3-clause BSD license, and that means you are free to do pretty much anything with them as long as you propagate the copyright and don't use ST and contributors' names for commercial endorsement or promotion.
https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause

### ARM - csmis
As advertised on arm's website, all CMSIS SW components are under the business-friendly Apache 2.0 license. It is a bit less permissive than BSD, and you should for example pay attention to the clauses regarding redistribution as they are a bit more developed (for example item #4).
