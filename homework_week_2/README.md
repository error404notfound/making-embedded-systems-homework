## NUCLEO-F446RE
### What kind of processor is it?
STM32F446RE
Core: Arm® 32-bit Cortex®-M4 CPU with FPU, Adaptive real-time accelerator (ART Accelerator) allowing 0-wait state execution from Flash memory, frequency up to 180 MHz, MPU, 225 DMIPS/1.25 DMIPS/MHz (Dhrystone 2.1), and DSP instructions

### How much Flash and RAM does it have? Any other memory types?
- 512 Kbytes of Flash memory
- 128 Kbytes of SRAM
- Flexible external memory controller with up to 16-bit data bus: SRAM, PSRAM, SDRAM/LPSDR SDRAM, NOR/NAND Flash memories

### Does it have any special peripherals? (List 3-5 that you find interesting.)

### If it has an ADC, what are the features?
-How much does the board cost vs what the processor costs? Is the processor in stock
anywhere? (Try Digikey, Mouser, Octopart, Google, and so on.)
